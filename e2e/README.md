# End-to-end test framework

The Go E2E runner builds the checked-out Router image, creates or reuses a Kind
cluster, deploys one named profile, runs that profile's registered test cases,
and writes `test-report.json` and `test-report.md` in the current directory.

A profile owns environment setup and a list of tests. A test case owns one
externally visible contract and can be reused by several profiles.

```text
e2e/cmd/e2e             command-line entry point
e2e/pkg/framework       cluster, profile lifecycle, execution, and reports
e2e/pkg/testcases       reusable test implementations and registry
e2e/profiles            deployment-specific profile implementations
e2e/config              focused Router configs for profiles and smoke tests
```

The scripts under [`testing/`](testing/) are older or specialized manual
utilities. New Kubernetes E2E coverage belongs in the Go runner unless the test
has a documented reason to remain a separate integration suite.

## Requirements

- Docker;
- Kind and `kubectl`;
- Helm;
- Go matching `e2e/go.mod`;
- enough local CPU, memory, and disk for the selected profile;
- credentials or accelerators declared by that profile.

The default run creates and deletes a Kind cluster named
`semantic-router-e2e`. Do not point `E2E_USE_EXISTING_CLUSTER=true` at a shared
or production cluster.

## Run a profile

From the repository root:

```bash
make e2e-test
```

The default profile is `envoy-ai-gateway`, which owns the broad Router contract.
Select another registered profile explicitly:

```bash
make e2e-test E2E_PROFILE=dashboard
make e2e-test E2E_PROFILE=routing-strategies
```

List the runner's current profile names and flags from the built binary:

```bash
make build-e2e
./bin/e2e -help
```

[`tools/agent/test-domain-registry.yaml`](../tools/agent/test-domain-registry.yaml)
records CI ownership, selection mode, and path triggers. Profile code remains
the source of truth for deployment behavior and its exact test list.

## Run selected test cases

```bash
make e2e-test-specific \
  E2E_PROFILE=envoy-ai-gateway \
  E2E_TESTS='chat-completions-request,decision-fallback-behavior'
```

Names must be registered under `e2e/testcases`. A test can be runnable by name
without being part of every profile's default contract.

## Keep an environment for debugging

```bash
make e2e-test-debug E2E_PROFILE=envoy-ai-gateway
```

Or split setup from repeated test runs:

```bash
make e2e-setup E2E_PROFILE=envoy-ai-gateway
make e2e-test-only E2E_PROFILE=envoy-ai-gateway
make e2e-test-only \
  E2E_PROFILE=envoy-ai-gateway \
  E2E_TESTS='chat-completions-request'
make e2e-cleanup
```

Use the same `E2E_CLUSTER_NAME` and profile for each command. `e2e-test-only`
assumes the expected releases, values, images, and Services are already in the
cluster; it does not reconcile drift first.

## Runner options

| Make variable | Default | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `E2E_PROFILE` | `envoy-ai-gateway` | Registered deployment profile. |
| `E2E_CLUSTER_NAME` | `semantic-router-e2e` | Kind cluster name. |
| `E2E_IMAGE_TAG` | `e2e-test` | Tag used for locally built images. |
| `E2E_KEEP_CLUSTER` | `false` | Preserve the cluster after the run. |
| `E2E_USE_EXISTING_CLUSTER` | `false` | Skip Kind creation and use current access. |
| `E2E_TESTS` | empty | Comma-separated test names; empty uses the profile list. |
| `E2E_PARALLEL` | `false` | Run selected test cases concurrently. |
| `E2E_VERBOSE` | `true` | Print lifecycle and test details. |
| `E2E_SETUP_ONLY` | `false` | Deploy the profile without tests. |
| `E2E_SKIP_SETUP` | `false` | Run against an already deployed profile. |
| `E2E_USE_WORKSPACE_MODELS` | `false` | Mount the workspace `models/` directory into a new Kind cluster. |

Parallel tests must not mutate the same runtime state. Leave parallel mode off
until the selected cases are known to be isolated.

## Profile selection

### Supported Profiles

- **dynamo**: manual NVIDIA Dynamo batching and GPU health coverage.
- **vectorstore-registry**: manual metadata restart-recovery coverage.

### Coverage Ownership Matrix

| Selection | Meaning | Source of truth |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Default local | Runs when no profile is specified | `default_local: true` in the test-domain registry |
| Full CI | Runs in the complete E2E matrix | `full_ci: true` in the test-domain registry |
| Affected | Selected when owned paths change | `selection: pr` and `paths` in the test-domain registry |
| Manual only | Requires explicit selection and profile prerequisites | `selection: manual` in the test-domain registry |

[`tools/agent/test-domain-registry.yaml`](../tools/agent/test-domain-registry.yaml)
owns the exact selection mode, path triggers, and coverage role for every entry.
“Manual” describes lifecycle and prerequisites; it is not evidence that the
profile passed in another environment.

## Add or change a profile

1. Add or update a package under `e2e/profiles/<name>`.
2. Implement `framework.Profile`: name, setup, teardown, test list, and Service
   access.
3. Register it in `e2e/profiles/all/imports.go`.
4. Add its ownership and selection mode to
   `tools/agent/test-domain-registry.yaml`.
5. Reuse test cases where the contract is shared; add a new test only for a new
   externally visible behavior.
6. Add deterministic assertions. A request that merely returned any response
   is not sufficient evidence for routing, safety, cache, or fallback behavior.

For test-case boundaries, read [`testcases/AGENTS.md`](testcases/AGENTS.md).

## Validate framework changes

```bash
make build-e2e
(cd e2e && go test ./...)
make agent-report ENV=cpu CHANGED_FILES='e2e/...'
```

Then run the smallest affected profile. Use
`make agent-e2e-affected CHANGED_FILES='...'` when the repository harness can
resolve the profile set from changed paths.

## Diagnose a failed run

The runner prints the failing test and writes reports even when the run fails.
With a preserved cluster:

```bash
kubectl get pods --all-namespaces
kubectl get events --all-namespaces --sort-by=.lastTimestamp
kubectl get gateway,httproute --all-namespaces
```

Separate setup failure, test assertion failure, and teardown failure. Keep the
profile only long enough to inspect it, then delete the named Kind cluster:

```bash
make e2e-cleanup E2E_CLUSTER_NAME=semantic-router-e2e
```
